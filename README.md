# House-Price-Prediction

This project deals with the prediction of the house prices using the given features of the dataset. 
The dataset for this project has been taken from Kaggle.

The features of the dataset are as follows:

SalePrice - the property's sale price in dollars. This is the target variable that you're trying to predict.

MSSubClass: The building class

MSZoning: The general zoning classification

LotFrontage: Linear feet of street connected to property

LotArea: Lot size in square feet

Street: Type of road access

Alley: Type of alley access

LotShape: General shape of property

LandContour: Flatness of the property

Utilities: Type of utilities available etc

Using the above features of the dataset, I have made an effort to find the prices of houses using Machine Learning Algorithms.
